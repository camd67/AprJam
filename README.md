# April Game Jam

## What went well
- Learned a lot about tile and mesh generation
- Learned to only go so far with an idea before switching
- Cheaper to switch early rather than late

## What didn't go well
- Didn't finish
- Got stuck at figuring out how to implement input
- Tried a really complex system that didn't work out
